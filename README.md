# tfm-validating-rdf-streams
Compendium of tools related to my Master's Thesis for validating RDF data streams, including:
- RDFShape: backend [API](https://github.com/weso/rdfshape-api) and frontend [client](https://github.com/weso/rdfshape-client). Visit the [repo](https://github.com/weso/rdfshape) to learn more.
- [Comet](https://github.com/ulitol97/comet): an in-house functional solution for validating RDF streams with Shape Expressions
- A [containerized demo](https://github.com/ulitol97/kafka-producer-demo) producing a data stream for testing.
