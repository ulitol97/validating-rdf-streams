# Validating RDF Streams
Compendium of tools related to my Master's Thesis for validating RDF data streams, including:
- [RDFShape](https://github.com/weso/rdfshape): backend [API](https://github.com/weso/rdfshape-api) and frontend [client](https://github.com/weso/rdfshape-client).
- [Comet](https://ulitol97.github.io/comet/): an in-house functional solution for validating RDF streams with Shape Expressions.
- A [containerized demo](https://github.com/ulitol97/kafka-producer-demo) producing a Kafka data stream for testing.
